# Hortulus

## Why Hortulus?

It means "little garden" in Latin.

Since I'm into gardening and cooking and the fact that both need some love and careful tending the name felt appealing.
Just a personal touch while also making some sense semantically.

Also to me Latin evokes a sense of "old and boring" which is exactly what I want from the foundations of my tech stack.
Also it specifically is a *small* garden because this is just my humble personal tooling, not some grand endevaour intended to take over the web by storm.
